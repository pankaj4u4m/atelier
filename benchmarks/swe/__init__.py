"""SWE-bench harness for Atelier.

Compares vanilla coding agents against Atelier-instrumented agents and
reports side-by-side numbers (cost, tokens, turns, time)
plus Atelier-specific metrics (ReasonBlock hits, monitor events, rescue
events, rubric verdicts).

Public entry points:

* :func:`benchmarks.swe.run_swe_bench.cli` — Click command group exposed
  as the ``atelier-bench`` console script.
* :class:`benchmarks.swe.config.BenchConfig`
* :class:`benchmarks.swe.modes.Mode`

Safety invariants
-----------------
* Never reads or passes the gold patch to the agent.
* Calibration ReasonBlock paths must not include eval task IDs.
* Every run records its config + git SHA for reproducibility.
