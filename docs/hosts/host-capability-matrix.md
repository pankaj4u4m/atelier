# Host Capability Matrix And Enforcement Contract

This matrix reflects currently available host capabilities as of 2026-05-02,
validated against upstream host docs and Atelier's integration scripts.

Atelier ships one runtime, but each host exposes a different control surface. The contract below
separates integration from enforcement so the project does not claim identical plugin behavior where
the host only supports advisory MCP/instruction workflows.

## Enforcement Levels

| Level               | Meaning                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `advisory`          | Atelier returns guidance or route decisions; the host/user remains responsible for following them.       |
| `hook_enforced`     | Host hooks can warn, block, or inject context around native tool events.                                 |
| `wrapper_enforced`  | An Atelier wrapper can gate task start, completion, or model flags before invoking the host CLI.         |
| `provider_enforced` | Atelier owns the model call path. Future-only unless a provider execution adapter is explicitly enabled. |

### RouteDecision vs RouteExecutionContract

A `RouteDecision` is a _decision artifact_: it records the chosen tier, confidence, reason, and
required verifiers for a single step. A `RouteExecutionContract` is a _host descriptor_: it states
whether the host can _enforce_ that decision (block start, require verification) or can only _advise_
on it.

Use `atelier_route_contract(host)` via MCP, or `atelier route contract --host <host>` via CLI, to
retrieve the serialisable contract for any supported host. The `provider_enforced` mode is always
`provider_enforced_disabled = true` in the returned contract until a future provider execution packet
explicitly enables it.

## Trace Confidence Levels

| Level          | Meaning                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `full_live`    | Live hooks record prompt, tool, edit, command, compact, and stop events.                       |
| `mcp_live`     | Atelier MCP calls and tool outputs are captured; native host edits/commands may be incomplete. |
| `wrapper_live` | Wrapper captures task start/end and validation results, but not every native host event.       |
| `imported`     | Host session data is imported after the run.                                                   |
| `manual`       | Agent must call `atelier_record_trace` with observable facts.                                  |

### Trace Metadata Fields

Every trace records four evidence fields that proof reports must expose:

- `host` — Host label derived from the agent string (e.g. `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `opencode`, `gemini`).
- `trace_confidence` — One of the five levels above.
- `capture_sources` — Active evidence channels (e.g. `["hooks", "mcp"]`).
- `missing_surfaces` — Host surfaces not captured (e.g. `["bash_outputs", "file_edits"]`).

See `docs/engineering/trace-confidence.md` for the full specification.

## Notes By Host

### Claude Code

- Native plugin path is first-class; Atelier ships a Claude plugin package under `integrations/claude/plugin/`.
- Hooks are available but should remain opt-in for safety. When disabled, routing and trace
  capture downgrade to MCP-only advisory behavior.
- MCP-only mode is a fallback, not the recommended path.

### Codex CLI

- Codex supports MCP natively (`codex mcp add` / `config.toml`), skills, and subagents.
- Codex can use reusable distribution and repo-local skills, but Atelier's current Codex surface is
  an integration, not the same Claude plugin package.
- Atelier adds a wrapper-style workflow to enforce reasoning preflight consistently.

### VS Code Copilot

- VS Code supports MCP servers in workspace/user `mcp.json` and exposes MCP tools/prompts in chat.
- Copilot integration quality is highest when combining MCP + chat mode + task shortcuts.
- Routing decisions are advisory unless the user runs a task/wrapper that can enforce the gate.

### opencode

- opencode supports MCP, agents, commands, and plugin ecosystem docs.
- Atelier uses workspace-local MCP config and an explicit Atelier agent profile for predictable behavior.

### Gemini CLI

- Gemini CLI supports MCP server configuration, `/mcp` management, custom commands, and extensions.
- Atelier installs a global MCP server entry and custom `atelier:*` command presets.

## Install Surface Summary

- Unified installer: `make install`
- Unified verification: `make verify`
- Per-host installers remain available as `scripts/install_<host>.sh` for advanced or dry-run workflows.

## Host-Specific Limitations

- Claude Code hooks can be strict; keep disabled by default unless workflow maturity requires enforcement.
- Codex wrapper pattern is additive; native Codex subagent/skills flow remains available.
- Copilot behavior depends on VS Code version and MCP trust state, and native chat edits may require
  manual or imported trace evidence.
- opencode and Gemini configurations vary between user-global and project-local scopes.
- `provider_enforced` is a contract placeholder only. It remains future-only and disabled in this
  packet unless a later provider execution packet explicitly enables it.
