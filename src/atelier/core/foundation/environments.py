"""Environments — Beseam-specific operating governors.

An Environment encodes the law for a class of work (e.g. publishing to
Shopify, classifying tracker traffic). It is enforced two ways:

1. At plan-check time: any plan step containing a `forbidden` phrase is
   blocked, and `required` items are surfaced as required checks.
2. At rubric-gate time: the `rubric_id` attached to the environment is
   the rubric whose checks must pass before the action is accepted.

Environments are read-only YAML files shipped with the package. They are
NOT user memory. They are reviewable, version-controlled operating laws.
