"""Plan checker — validate a proposed agent plan against ReasonBlocks.

The plan checker is the most important entry point in v1. It is what
turns the runtime from "nice docs" into "actively prevents known dead
ends before the agent edits files".

A plan is a list of human-readable steps the agent intends to take. We:

1. Retrieve relevant ReasonBlocks for the task context.
2. For each block, scan plan steps for substrings matching its dead-ends.
3. For each block, scan plan steps for the keywords that would indicate
   verification was included. If verification is mandated by the block
   but missing from the plan, raise a warning (or block, for high-risk
   domains).
4. Compose a suggested-plan patch from the procedure of the most relevant
   matched block(s).

Severity rules (kept intentionally simple):
- dead-end match     → high
- missing verification (high-risk domain) → high
- missing verification (other domains)    → medium
- low-confidence match (only triggers, no scope) → low

Output status:
- blocked → any high-severity warning
- warn    → any medium/low warnings
- pass    → no warnings
