"""Routing execution contract (WP-31).

A ``RouteExecutionContract`` is a serialisable description of whether a specific
host can *enforce* an Atelier route decision or can only *advise* on it.

Execution modes
---------------
advisory
    Atelier returns the route decision to the agent.  The host/user decides
    whether to follow it.  This is the safe default for any host where Atelier
    has no hook or wrapper surface.

wrapper_enforced
    An Atelier wrapper (e.g. ``atelier-codex``) gates task start, model flags,
    or completion.  The wrapper can block start, enforce required flags, or
    withhold success without verification.

provider_enforced
    Atelier would perform the model call through a configured provider adapter.
    **This mode is future-only and must not be selected at runtime.**  It is
    present in the schema so that callers can confirm it is disabled.

Hook-style enforcement (``hook_enforced`` for Claude Code) is represented as
``wrapper_enforced`` with ``can_block_start=True`` because hooks are an
opt-in wrapper surface in Atelier's extension model.
